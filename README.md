This is a nextjs/react, typescript project harnessing the power of jest for testing, nodejs for the backend and mongodb for data storage. The purpose of the application is to showcase my projects and document my learning process as I continue down the endless rabbit hole of software engineering.

## Getting Started

Traverse to where you want the files stored and, in your terminal run the following:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/cbass2404/cory-bass-portfolio
$ cd cory-bass-portfolio
$ npm install
```

Run Commands:

1. npm start
    - runs the production server
2. npm run dev
    - runs the development server
3. npm run build
    - produces a production optimized version of the app
